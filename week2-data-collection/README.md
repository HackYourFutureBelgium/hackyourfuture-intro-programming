## Learning Objectives

- Understand different data types

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Data Types Identification

Create a JavaScript file that:

1. Creates variables of different data types (string, number, boolean, array, object)
2. Logs each variable's type using typeof
3. Creates a function that takes different data types and returns their type

### Exercise 2: Data Collection Form

Create a simple HTML form that collects:

- Name (text input)
- Email (email input)
- Age (number input)
- Programming experience (dropdown: beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- Interests (checkboxes: web dev, data science, mobile apps, games)
