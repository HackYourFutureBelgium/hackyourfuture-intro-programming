# Project Board Guide for Coaches

## Overview

This project board helps track student progress through the 12-week curriculum. Each student's weekly check-in issue becomes a card on the board.

## Board Columns

### Not Started

- New issues automatically placed here
- Students who haven't started the current week

### In Progress

- Issues move here when students add week labels (week1, week2, etc.)
- Students are actively working on exercises

### Review Needed

- Issues move here when students add the "reviewed" label
- Waiting for coach feedback

### Completed

- Issues move here with the "completed" label
- Students have finished the module

### Blocked

- Issues move here with the "help-wanted" label
- Students need assistance

## How to Use

### For Coaches:

1. **Monitor Progress**: View columns to see where each student is
2. **Provide Feedback**: Click on cards to comment on issues
3. **Move Cards**: Drag cards between columns or use labels to automate
4. **Filter View**: Use the filter button to view specific weeks or students

### For Students:

1. Create a new issue using the weekly template
2. The issue will automatically appear on the project board
3. Use labels to update your status:
   - Add week label (e.g., "week1") when you start
   - Add "reviewed" when you want feedback
   - Add "completed" when you finish
   - Add "help-wanted" if you're stuck
